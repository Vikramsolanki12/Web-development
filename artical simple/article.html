            <b>kabaddi</b>, game played between two teams on opposite halves of a<br>
             field or <i>court</i>. Individual players take turns crossing onto the<br>
              other team’s side, repeating “kabaddi, kabaddi” (or an alternate<br>
               chant); points are scored by tagging as many opponents as<br> 
               possible without being caught or taking a breath before returning<br>
                to one’s home territory. </p>
        <p>It has been speculated that the game originated in prehistoric times,<br>
             when the development of human reflexes was crucial for self-defense<br>
              and hunting.</p>
        <p>The ancient Indian epic poem Mahabharata, in its account of the legendary<br>
             battles of Kurukshetra, tells of a military operation—a doomed raid by<br>
              Arjuna’s son, Abhimanyu, on an enemy camp—that has been noted for its<br>
               resemblance to kabaddi.</p>
        <p>For many years kabaddi was played for physical exercise by pupils in Indian<br>
             gurukuls (Vedic schools run by gurus). Though minor variations emerged,<br>
              the game’s principal objective of raiding the enemy territory remained common.
        </p>
        <p>By the early 21st century international competition typically involved seven<br>
             players per team performing on a rectangular court, although other styles<br> 
             (such as “circular” kabaddi) remained popular in India and elsewhere.<br>
